## Introduction
This is a 3D game made with Unity where you play as a zoo keeper.  It was made in 48 hours as a game development challenge.

It utilizes Unity's Universal Render Pipeline, the new input system, free graphics assets, and the Terrain Tools.

# Implementation

My implementation includes:
- Character Controller 
- Player health system
- Enemies that use Navmesh (bear, tiger, and spiders chasing the player)
- A custom event system
- Pause menu with resume, options, and exit
- Sound effects
- Visual effects such as water, wind, trees, grass, and flowers
- Cinemachine virtual camera controlled by mouse position
- Gamepad support for player movements
- Git Large File Storage (LFS) 
- Texture compression for windows build
